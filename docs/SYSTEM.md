## 3. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### 3.1 Core Processing Requirements

#### FR-001: Real-Time Data Processing
**Priority:** Critical  
**Requirement:** The system SHALL process sensor inputs at a minimum rate of 20Hz (50ms maximum inter-frame interval).  
**Rationale:** Maintains tracking continuity for fast-moving objects.  
**Verification:** Performance testing with synthetic and real sensor data.

#### FR-002: Multi-Object Tracking
**Priority:** High  
**Requirement:** The system SHALL simultaneously track up to 100 distinct objects within the sensor field of view.  
**Rationale:** Supports dense environment monitoring scenarios.  
**Verification:** Load testing with simulated multi-target scenarios.

#### FR-003: Fault-Tolerant Input Handling
**Priority:** Critical  
**Requirement:** The system SHALL handle out-of-order and dropped sensor inputs gracefully without system failure.  
**Rationale:** Sensor networks may experience packet loss or timing variations.  
**Verification:** Fault injection testing with controlled input corruption.

#### FR-004: State Estimation
**Priority:** Critical  
**Requirement:** The system SHALL output stable track estimates including position, velocity, and uncertainty bounds for each tracked object.  
**Rationale:** Downstream systems require reliable state information for decision making.  
**Verification:** Statistical analysis of tracking accuracy against ground truth.

### 3.2 Data Management Requirements

#### FR-005: Input Validation
**Priority:** Critical  
**Requirement:** The system SHALL validate all sensor inputs against defined schemas and reject malformed data.  
**Rationale:** Prevents corrupted data from propagating through the system.  
**Verification:** Unit testing with malformed input datasets.

#### FR-006: Track Persistence
**Priority:** Medium  
**Requirement:** The system SHALL maintain track continuity for objects temporarily occluded or outside sensor range for up to 5 seconds.  
**Rationale:** Reduces track fragmentation in dynamic environments.  
**Verification:** Scenario testing with controlled occlusion patterns.

## 4. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### 4.1 Performance Requirements

#### NFR-001: Processing Latency
**Priority:** Critical  
**Requirement:** The system SHALL process each input frame within 5ms of receipt.  
**Rationale:** Real-time applications require predictable, low-latency responses.  
**Verification:** Timing analysis under maximum load conditions.  
**Acceptance Criteria:** 99.9% of frames processed within 5ms threshold.

#### NFR-002: Memory Utilization
**Priority:** High  
**Requirement:** The system SHALL operate within 50MB of total memory allocation during normal operation.  
**Rationale:** Enables deployment on resource-constrained embedded systems.  
**Verification:** Memory profiling during extended operation cycles.  
**Acceptance Criteria:** Peak memory usage < 50MB for 24-hour continuous operation.

#### NFR-003: Deterministic Timing
**Priority:** High  
**Requirement:** The system SHALL provide deterministic update timing with jitter < 1ms.  
**Rationale:** Predictable behavior required for integration with real-time systems.  
**Verification:** Statistical timing analysis over 10,000 processing cycles.

### 4.2 Reliability Requirements

#### NFR-004: System Availability
**Priority:** Critical  
**Requirement:** The system SHALL achieve 99.9% availability during operational periods.  
**Rationale:** Mission-critical applications cannot tolerate extended downtime.  
**Verification:** Long-duration reliability testing (MTBF analysis).

#### NFR-005: Graceful Degradation
**Priority:** High  
**Requirement:** The system SHALL continue operating with reduced functionality when non-critical components fail.  
**Rationale:** Partial system operation is preferable to complete failure.  
**Verification:** Component failure simulation testing.

### 4.3 Safety and Security Requirements

#### NFR-006: Input Sanitization
**Priority:** Critical  
**Requirement:** The system SHALL sanitize all external inputs to prevent buffer overflows and injection attacks.  
**Rationale:** Security vulnerabilities could compromise system integrity.  
**Verification:** Static analysis and penetration testing.

#### NFR-007: Safe State Behavior
**Priority:** Critical  
**Requirement:** Upon detection of critical errors, the system SHALL transition to a safe state within 100ms.  
**Rationale:** Prevents hazardous conditions in safety-critical applications.  
**Verification:** Fault injection and safety analysis testing.
